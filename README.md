# Lanota Score Calculator
A simple tool to calculate the score achieved in the rhythm game, Lanota.
## How the scoring system works
As in the case of many other rhythm games such as Cytus, Deemo, etc., Lanota also features a **combo score** system, but with some twists.
### Basic values
**Base note score**: 920 000 points are split equally between all notes in the song.<br/>
A Tune note is worth only 10/23 (approx. 43.475%) of a Harmony note's base value. Combo score is not modified by this rule.<br/> 
**Combo score rules**:
1. Unlike Deemo or Cytus where combo score increases over time as your combo grows, the combo score actually *decreases* in this game.<br/>
Thus, the first note hit in every song worths the most points in any chart.<br/>
Each following notes will have its value decreased by one **combo score unit**, up to half the note count, at which point the combo score will quickly decrease to a constant value, depending on the note count:
- If the note count is odd, it is decreased quickly over the next two notes,
- otherwise, it is decreased quickly over the next note.
2. If your current combo is less than or equal to your max combo achieved in a specific song, you won't get any combo score.<br/>
E.g. You achieved a combo of 200 before Failing a note. The next note hit will not award combo score, regardless of whether it is a Harmony or Tune note.
3. The combo score's decreasing process carries over if you break a combo, but resumed it later.<br/>
E.g. You achieved a combo of 5 before Failing a note. As per the rule mentioned in **1.**, the last note hit in the previous combo has its combo score decreased by four **combo score units**. If you resume a combo later, as your combo counter hits 6, that very note will have its combo score decreased by five **combo score units**.
### Detailed score formulae
**Base note score:** $frac{920000}{(note\textunderscore count)} \text{ (1)}$<br/>
**Combo score unit:** $combo\_score\_unit = \frac{160000}{(note\textunderscore count)^2}\text{ (2)}$<br/>
**Difference between the maximum and minimum points awarded by a note:** $frac{160000}{(note\textunderscore count)} \text{ (3)}$<br/>
**First note score:** Equals to the sum of [1] and [3], minus 0.5 **combo score units**.  
$$first\textunderscore note\textunderscore score = \frac{920000}{note\textunderscore count}+\frac{160000}{note\textunderscore count}-\frac{80000}{note\textunderscore count^2} \text{ (4)}$$
**Following note scores:** Equals to [4] minus an appropriate multiple of **combo score unit**.  
$$\displaylines{note\textunderscore score_{i+1} = first\textunderscore note\textunderscore score - i \times combo\textunderscore score\textunderscore unit\\ where\text{ i} \leq \lfloor note\textunderscore count \div 2\rfloor} \text{ (5)}$$  
**Rapid combo score decrement:**<br/>
If note count is odd:
- the next note's score is decreased by $d_1 \times combo\textunderscore score\textunderscore unit$,
- the note following that one has its score decreased by $d_2 \times combo\textunderscore score\textunderscore unit$; where
$$\displaylines{d_1 + d_2 = cff;\\ d_1 - d_2 = 0.75;\\ cff = (note\textunderscore count) \div 4 + 1} \text{ (6)}$$
otherwise:
- the next note's score is decreased by $d \times combo\textunderscore score\textunderscore unit$,
where $$d = (note\textunderscore count) \div 4 + 0.5 \text{ (7)}$$
- Following that, all notes worth a constant point value:
$$min\textunderscore note\textunderscore score = first\textunderscore note \textunderscore score - \frac{160000}{note\textunderscore count} \text{ (8)}$$
## Program function
### Requirements
The program is written in Python 3.10, so Python 3.x is required to run it. No other packages is necessary.
### Components
**lanota.py**: The main executable file.
**notedata.csv**: The result file, containing data regarding note count, base note score, combo score unit, tune base note score, and score progression across the song.<br/>
Score progression includes combo count, note score, cumulative score (exact / rounded in-game which might has minor errors).<br/>
Will be created if not exist.
### Usage
Launch **lanota.py**.<br/>
Enter a single number, which is the note count of your chart.<br/>
All the results mentioned above will be packed into **notedata.csv**.
